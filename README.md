# Monkey Language Interpreter

Tue May 21 -> Currently working through Chapter 2.6
Just finished adding String() to nodes.

Learned: Something about syntax free grammars or something idk Noam Chomskey is related to it or something.

Pratt Parsing is good for parsing expressions - things that are not best represented by grammar rules,
but rather by precidence.

12:10 AM -> finished adding functions to parser for expression parsing (page 53 - Identifers)
